# Hello, I’m Ana!

A Junior Manual QA Tester with practical experience in web, mobile and API testing. Currently, I work as a QA Trainee at GenofIT, where I’m involved in the full testing cycle — reviewing requirements, designing and executing test cases, validating functionality and UI workflows, performing regression and exploratory testing, reporting bugs in Jira, and participating in Agile/Scrum processes. I also have experience with backend data validation using SQL and API testing with Postman, ensuring accurate system behaviour and reliable integrations. Having completed a UX/UI Design course, I evaluate interfaces not only from a functional perspective but also from a usability and user experience standpoint, which helps me support the delivery of intuitive, user-centred digital products. I am committed to continuous learning, attention to detail, and contributing to product quality and team collaboration.
