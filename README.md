# Hello, I’m Ana!

**A Junior Manual QA** Tester with dedicated experience in web, mobile, and API testing.

Currently, I work **full-time as a Junior Manual QA Tester** at the US-based company **Origins AI**, where I contribute to product quality through rigorous **Smoke, Regression, and Functional testing**. My main focus is on comprehensive **End-to-End and Frontend Functional testing,** which includes writing detailed Test Cases, Scenarios, and Checklists, validating critical User Flows, and ensuring UI integrity. I actively collaborate with developers in an Agile/Scrum environment and specialise in utilising Jira/Xray integration for test management, specifically for creating and managing daily runs of critical Smoke Test Sets and diagnosing/resolving technical issues within testing tools.

My experience as a **QA Trainee at GenofIT** also includes backend data validation using **SQL, API testing with Postman**, and a unique focus on usability and user experience (UX/UI Design course background), allowing me to evaluate interfaces from both a functional and user-centred perspective. I am committed to continuous learning, attention to detail, and maintaining a high standard of product quality.

## 🔍 Projects & Experience (NDA Compliant)

I have worked on multiple commercial projects. Due to confidentiality agreements, project names, company names, and specific proprietary details are not disclosed. However, the structure and logic of QA work are demonstrated through anonymised:

- Test Cases
- Bug Reports
- Checklists
- QA Documentation Samples

These examples illustrate my approach to identifying requirements, analysing functionality, designing test scenarios, executing test cycles, reporting issues, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.
