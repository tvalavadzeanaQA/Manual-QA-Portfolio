# Manual-QA-Portfolio

Hello! I’m Ana — a Manual QA specialist with hands-on experience in testing web and mobile applications.  
I focus on delivering high–quality products through structured testing approaches, clear documentation, and effective communication with development teams.

This repository presents selected examples of my QA work, while respecting confidentiality agreements (NDA).  
All materials here are anonymized or recreated for demonstration purposes.

## 🔍 Projects & Experience (NDA Compliant)

I have worked on multiple commercial projects, including:

- Web-based internal management systems
- E-commerce platforms
- Customer-facing mobile applications
- REST API integrations

Due to confidentiality agreements, project names, company names, and specific proprietary details are not disclosed.  
However, the structure and logic of QA work are demonstrated through anonymized:

- Test Cases

These examples illustrate my approach to identifying requirements, analyzing functionality, designing test scenarios, executing test cycles, reporting issues, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.
